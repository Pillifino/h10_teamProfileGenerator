# h10_teamProfileGenerator

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a team profile generator usine node to run our index.js file. The user will be able to answer a series of question in order to generate a unique html file that displays the employees in cards. The employee info is based on classes which will generate the appropriate questions and info in both node and the html file.
